Game:

The player must control the boat and shoot fireballs to kill the two purple enemies.

The player's health is depicted on the title bar of the screen. If the player health is 0 then he is respawned 
in the center with full health.

The player can loose health by touching the enemies or hitting the rocks.

There are barrels with yellow powerups on top of them. One must jump over them to obtain the powerup. The 
powerup provides different bullets with new range and invincibility for a short period of time.

When an enemy is killed he drops a red gift which grants the player extra health.

Once both health pickups have been obtained from the enemies the boss appears.

The boss follows the player around indefinitely and the player can get damaged by touching the boss.

The boss occasionally performs a move where he turns red and a spike rises from underneath the boat causing damage.

The boss health is displayed on the title bar of the screen when the boss appears.

The player can win the game by defeating the boss.
